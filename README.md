Every year, there are millions of movies released around the world in many
different genres. Therefore, there is a vast amount of movie data available on the
internet. IMDb is the most popular website that maintains movie dataset. In this
project, I have build a MySQL database using the Internet Movie Database
(IMDb) dataset. The dataset contains 7 compressed tab-separated-value
(*.tsv) files that can be downloaded from IMDb website. This project helped me gain better insights about database systems.
